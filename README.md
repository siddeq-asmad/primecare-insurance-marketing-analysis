# PrimeCare - Insurance Marketing Analysis

## The goal of this project is to investigate the performance of marketing campaigns at PrimeCare in order to surface recommendations on marketing budget allocation across future campaign categories.
**Founded in 2016, PrimeCare is a medical insurance company serving thousands of customers throughout the United States. In 2019, they launched a  new set of marketing campaign categories** spanning topics like wellness tips, affordability and preventive care. Their customers can sign up for 4 different plans - Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum - each with different premiums and claim coverage rates.

Now that they've hired a new data team and are strategsing their marketing budget for the year, the company would like to build more understanding of the effectiveness of these campaigns categories and how they relate to signups and subsequent patient claims. The budget is allocated to drive two primary objectives:
1. Increate the number of customer signups
2. Raise awareness of PrimeCare's brand across the country.
